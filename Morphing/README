To run my code, uncomment the lines at the end of main.py that corresponds to the method you would like to run.

main_normal: This runs the morph method
This method expects two images in the ./images/ folder. To run, input the command:
python main.py image1.jpg image2.jpg
Where image1 and image2 are the names of the two images. If no point data exists, you will be asked to choose a number of points on the two images, and a .txt file will be created and saved into the folder "./points/".

main_average: This computes the population average image
This method requires the point data in a folder called "average_pts". The downloaded data must first be parsed using: python parse.py
This will place the point data in the "average_pts" folder.
This method also expects the images in a folder called "average_images"
To run: (after uncommenting)
python main.py

main_caricature: This computes a caricature of an image named "face.jpg".
This requires the previous method to have run and completed, and thus shares all the requirements from the previous method.
To run:
python main.py

main_genderswap: This computes a genderswap of an imaged named "face_test.jpg" and an image named "random_face_test.jpg". This method expects them in the "./images/" folder.
To run:
python main.py
